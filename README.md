##Self Paced Area Migration.


Very well this will be a kind of jonal to others mentioning how i managed to become a Data Scientist.
that being said i will make sure that most of things around here are free (to learn).
Some certifications may have costs and other expenses but as i bump on them i will make sure to report here.<br>


First things first... Learn to navigate on GITHUB (is not suposed to be that hard.... lets see!!)<br><br>

good.. with that out of the way we star other things. (ok i started a few days ago but didnÂ´t have the plan to write here...but well... why not!!)<br>

just earned my SQL basics certificate, now i can undestand SQL language if needed, made on linkedin, very good material from professor Scott Simpson (may use some for my final purpose of building that text game... will see....)<br><br><br>

Just learned that i can make a great journal on Jupyter Notebook... i guess i will migrate to it and the complete Code/library here!<br>


so the first task is ready. a simple calculator on python check in the learning python section.
