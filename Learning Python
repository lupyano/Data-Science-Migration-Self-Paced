Very well... i decided to learn Python, just because.<br>

of course not... seems that python is no rising in 2021 so i want to surf this wave! <br>

so.... while i get the syntax of it in shape i plan on building a simple text game where you are suposed to climb a tower and defeat your enemies... lets see how this goes!<br>

started with Codecademy there they had exercices on browser. pretty fun ðŸ˜†!! <br>
several hours of learning there.<br>

started a free course (https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br) seems they put some free content every month so...<br><br><br><br>

Using Python on ANACONDA since the plan is to use on Data Science. and also using Google Colab
<br><br><br><br>
As first project i will make a simple calculator, with the four basics operations. Link here!
